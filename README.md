My Python solutions without any module other than standard library.

For each day, day*DD*.py is the full solution for part one and two.

day*DD*<b>_1</b>.py is my own solution for parts one only, before discovering part two. 

day*DD*<b>_2</b>.py is my own solution for parts one and two, before looking at internet or other solutions. 

One can consider the difference to see if a lot of refactoring was needed for part two.
